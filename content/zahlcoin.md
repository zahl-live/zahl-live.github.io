Zahl Coin (â„¤) is a new experimental cryptocurrency on top of the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) blockchain ecosystem. It is a decentralized project that is maintained by Zahl Live Community on the World Wide Web, and is intended to be used for educational, vocational and recreational purposes only.

In mathematics, the set of integers is often denoted by the letter "Z", standing originally for the German word Zahl/Zahlen ("numbers"). An integer is often a primitive data type in computer programming languages, Thus, the project is trying to create an experimental monetary system without floating points.
